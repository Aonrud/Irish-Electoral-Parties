This is the source repository for the Timeline of Electoral Parties in the Republic of Ireland.

**This is currently in a draft state**

### Data

* Main current electoral parties are all included, along with a scattering of others. Far from complete list.
* Several Wikipedia links are missing.

### Implementation

* Proper layout depends on either manual row positioning or new Timeline.js version.
* CSS is incomplete.
