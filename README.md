This is the source repository for the Timeline of Electoral Parties in the Republic of Ireland.

**This is currently in a draft state**

## Data

The party information is collated in [`parties.csv`](parties.csv). The diagram draws its information directly from this file, and will include an information box when an entry is clicked if a Wikipedia link is included.

### Inclusion criteria

Parties are included if:

1. they have held seats at local or Oireachtas level in the Republic of Ireland, including by defection/formation by representatives elected for another party;
2. they have at some point in their existence stood candidates for election, including where those candidates were officially 'Independent' due to lack of registration but were known to be running under the party banner.

### Current status

* Main current electoral parties are all included, along with a scattering of others. Far from complete list.
* Several Wikipedia links are missing.

## Implementation

### Current status

* Proper layout depends on either manual row positioning or new Timeline.js version.
* CSS is incomplete.
